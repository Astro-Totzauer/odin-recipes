    <p>
        This delightful Hungarian dish is one of my favorite weekday dinners - very easy to make, easy to customize and pairs with so many different sides!
    </p>
    <p>
        I typically pair this with rice, but if I have time I love making dumplings to go along with it. A side salad or roasted vegetables round out a great meal with this.
