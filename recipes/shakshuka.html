        One of my favorite meals to prepare at home is shakshuka, a North African dish comprising poached eggs floating in
        a spicy tomato sauce with garlic, onions and peppers, though this recipe lends itself well to customization with all
        sorts of other ingredients.

        Personally, I like to make my shakshuka pretty spicy, adding garlic chili crisp, red pepper flakes and some hot peppers 
        to the mix. While feta is a common addition, various cheeses can be added - goat cheese, mozzarella, etc, and most 
        separately-cooked proteins mix well with it too. I like to add ground pork or beef, leftover steak or chicken to mine.
